# ASCINET
Advanced SSH Computer Intranet

## The Idea 
I was playing fallout shelter when I thinked of a network : send messages or files over a protocol(not wifi, ssh maybe, but i dont know how it works/how to send messages and files), with the access rights : supervisor computer can send and receive to the main server, but other computers can only receive messages and send files. How to code this in Rust ?
